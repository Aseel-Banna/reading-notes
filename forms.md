# Forms Submission
- A client (usually a web browser) sends a request to a server using the HTTP protocol.  
- The server answers the request using the same protocol.
- The <form> element defines how the data will be sent.
- The two most important attributes are action and method.
- The action attribute defines where the data gets sent. 
- Its value must be a valid relative or absolute URL.
- It's possible to specify a URL that uses the HTTPS (secure HTTP) protocol. 
- The method attribute defines how data is sent.
- The HTTP protocol provides several ways to perform a request.
- HTML form data can be transmitted via a number of different methods.
- The most common being the GET method and the POST method.
- The GET method is the method used by the browser to ask the server to send back a given resource.
- The browser sends an empty body.
- The POST method is the browser uses to talk to the server when asking for a response that takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request.
