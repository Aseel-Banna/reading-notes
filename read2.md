# jQuery
- It is a javascript library.
- You can use it as an object and then add methods for it.
- Older browsers do not support the latest methods for selecting elements.
- jQuery's motto is "Write less, do more," because it allows you to achieve the same goals but in fewer lines of code than you would need to write with plain JavaScript. 
- You can select either one element or multi elements in jQuery.
-  There is no need to use a loop when a selector returns multiple elements, you can update all of them using the one method. 
- If you want to use more than one jQuery method on the same selection of elements, you can list several methods at a time using dot notation to separate each one.
- The html () and text () methods both retrieve and update the content of elements. 
- html() : This method gives every element in the matched set the same new content.
- replaceWith(): This method replaces every element in a matched set with new content.
- text(): This method gives every element in the matched set the same new text content. 
- remove(): This method removes all of the elements in the matched set. 
- Inserting new elements involves two steps:
  1: Create the new elements in a jQuery object
  2: Use a method to insert the content into the page 
- before() : This method inserts content before the selected element(s) .
- prepend() : This method inserts content inside the selected element(s), after the opening tag.
- after() : This method inserts content after the selected element(s).
- append() : This method inserts content inside the selected element(s),before the closing tag. 
- You can create attributes, or access and update their contents, using the following four methods. 
- The css () method lets you retrieve and set the values of CSS properties. 
- jQuery allows you to recreate the functionality of a loop on a selection of elements, using the each () method. 
- The on () method is used to handle all events. 
- Every event handling function receives an event object. 
- When you start using jQuery, the effects methods can enhance your web page with transitions and movement. 
- The animate() method allows you to create some of your own effects and animations by changing CSS properties. 

- When a page loads jQuery from a CDN, you will often see a syntax  starts with a <**script**> tag that tries to load the jQuery file from the CDN.
- The position of <**script**> elements can affect how quickly a web page seems to load. 


# Article: 6 Reasons for Pair Programming 
[6 Reasons for Pair Programming]('https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/') 
- Improving the quality, you can use iterative loops, code reviews, fast feedback and error checking and linting.
- Pair programming is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together. 
- Pair Programming involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator.
  - The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard.
  - The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.
- Pair Programming use skills of developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to othersâ€™ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves. 
- Greater efficiency: It is a common misconception that pair programming takes a lot longer and is less efficient.
- Engaged collaboration: When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone.
- Learning from fellow students: Working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of.
- Social skills: When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key.
- Job interview readiness: The current employee and an applicant will carry out exercises together, such as code challenges, building a project or feature, or debugging an existing code base.
- Work environment readiness: Code Fellows graduates who are already familiar with how pairing works can hit the ground running at a new job, with one less hurdle to overcome.
