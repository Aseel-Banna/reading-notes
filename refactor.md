# Concepts of Functional Programming in Javascript
- Functional programming is a programming paradigm
- It is a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs 
- Functional programming is pure functions
- We can say that a function is pure if:
  - It returns the same result if given the same arguments
  - It does not cause any observable side effects
- We can say that a function is impure if it uses a global object that was not passed as a parameter to the function.
- Pure functions are stable, consistent, and predictable.
- Given the same parameters, pure functions will always return the same result.
- When data is immutable, its state cannot change after itâ€™s created. 
- ***pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency***
- The idea of functions as first-class entities is that functions are also treated as values and used as data.
- When we talk about higher-order functions, we mean a function that either:
  - takes one or more functions as arguments, or
  - returns a function as its result


# Refactoring JavaScript for Performance and Readability
- Refactoring Your Code means that you have to edit your code in easier way to get the same result, so it will be more readable.
- A hash function is used to map a given key to a location in the hash table.
