# Reading Notes
Hello there, I am Aseel Albanna, a computer and software engineer. <br> As you know, computer engineering has many departments and fields, but actually, one of these fields and departments has faced my intreset, which is development.<br> I like how to convert your own ideas that are placed in your mind to features that people can use and deal with.  So, I decided to start working on my graduation project, which is a medical android application, with no idea about the tools, enviroments, languages, ...etc. But one of my special princibles in life that <b>I know how to know</b>.
<br>Actually, there are many ways to start learning ***"from zero to hero"*** as they said, the first step is to start **reading** articles or chapters from books that are related to the subject you are learning about. After that, **applying** what you have read by taking one of the ideas nd starting to convert it to feature/s.
<br>I have finished my work on my graduation project within 4 months and I had get ***“A”***. I am so proud of that, I consider that as one/first bigest achievment in my life. Since it was the starting point for next levels. 
### After the graduation, I attented a free scholarship for ***Software Development*** in LTUC-ASAC.
#### This repo is creadted to include all my reading notes during my journey in LTUC-ASAC.
### Here you can find all of my reading notes during all levels.
