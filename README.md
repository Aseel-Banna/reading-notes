# Reading Notes
Hello there, I am Aseel Albanna, I am a computer engineer. My interest in software development began when I was working on my graduation project, which was a medical application (Android Application). So, I had to learn and read about android mobile applications to get a general idea about the enviroment and frameworks. I started working and learning how to use Android Studio to make a medical application with different features that can help patients to ease their life. Even healthy people can use this app as a medicine dictionary.
### I have finished my work within 4 months and I had get “A” in graduation project and I am so proud of that. 
### After the graduation, I attented a free scholarship for ***Software Development*** in LTUC-ASAC.
#### This repo is creadted to include all my reading notes during my journey in LTUC-ASAC.
### Here you can find all of my reading notes during all levels.
